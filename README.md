# Data-Analytic-with-Excel-and-R-Capstone-Project

Project Title: Urban Bike-Sharing Forecasting and Optimization Worldwideâ€‹

For Capstone Project: 
This project analyzes the impact of weather on bike-sharing demand in urban areas, with a focus on Seoul and extending to other global cities. It involves building predictive models to forecast bike-sharing demand based on weather conditions and creating interactive maps and dashboards to visualize these insights.

The tasks of this project are as follows:

Task-1: Data Collecting by using OpenWeatherMap API, Direct downloading from IBM Cloud Storage and Web Scraping.
Task-2: Data Wrangling.
Task-3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL and Visualization. 
Task-4: Building a Predictive Model and Evaluating the models to choose the best one for Seoul Rented Bike Count and Using pre-trained model in Dashboarding.
Task-5: Creating interactive Dashboard.

Methodology:
The project involves using various data science techniques and tools for data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization. Predictive modeling was performed using regression models, and the performance was evaluated to choose the best one for predicting number of rented bike in Seoul. Interactive dashboards was developed using R Shiny to provide visualization of weather impacts on bike-sharing demand for global cities.
